Description
-----------

Sets the neutrons information in the sample. You can either enter
details about the chemical formula or atomic number, or you can
provide specific values for the attenuation and scattering cross
sections and the sample number density. If you decide to provide
specific values you must give values for all three (attenuation and
scattering cross sections and the sample number density), and any
formula information will be ignored. If you miss any of the three
specific values then the other will be ignored. For details of how the
various quantities are calculated, refer to the :ref:`Materials`
concept page.

.. note:: It is recommended that you use :ref:`SetSample <algm-SetSample>` instead.
